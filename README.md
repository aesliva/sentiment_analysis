NOTE: This is a proof of concept/personal experiment, it's really barebones right now. The model needs more training data to be accurate. I'm actively working on it.

Why?

I created this application from an idea I had to draw in-depth insight from player feedback for my video game. I've been fascinated by machine learning and AI for a while now and it's been fun trying to figure things out and get a small scale model going.
The goal is to have a fairly accurate ML model that can find weaknesses and strengths of the video game based on player feedback. Ideally there would be a visual representation of how feedback evolved over time and mapping it with product releases.
